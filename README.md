That's great progress! Since you've covered **Spring Data JPA**, a good project should let you dive deeper into:

* Entity relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany)
* Composite keys
* Custom queries (JPQL or native SQL)
* Specifications / Criteria API (for advanced filtering)
* Pagination and sorting
* Auditing (created/modified timestamps, user tracking)

### 💡 **Project Idea: Equipment Rental Management System**

#### 🧩 Concept:

A system for managing rentals of different types of equipment (e.g. tools, cameras, bikes) with complex relationships between users, inventory, rental agreements, payments, and reviews.

---

### 🗃️ Database Design Highlights (Spring Data Focus)

* **Users**

  * `id`, `name`, `email`, `role (admin/customer)`

* **Equipment**

  * `id`, `name`, `type`, `brand`, `pricePerDay`, `available`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
  * One-to-many with `Rental`, Many-to-many with `Tag`

* **Tag**

  * e.g., `"heavy"`, `"portable"`, `"outdoor"` — Many-to-many with `Equipment`

* **Rental**

  * Composite relationship between `User` and `Equipment`
  * `id`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `status (reserved, in-use, returned)`
  * Audit info (timestamps + optionally who created it)
  * Price calculated at runtime

* **Payment**

  * `id`, `rental_id`, `method`, `amount`, `status (pending, paid, failed)`, `timestamp`

* **Review**

  * `id`, `user_id`, `equipment_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `createdAt`

---

### 🧑‍💻 Features to Implement

* Admin can **add/edit equipment**, assign tags
* Users can **search/filter equipment** (by tag, brand, availability)
* Users can **rent equipment** (start/end dates, check availability)
* Generate **rental summary** with total cost
* **Track payments** for rentals
* Leave **reviews** after rental is complete
* View **rental history** per user

---

### 🧪 Spring Data JPA Learning Opportunities

* Multiple relationships per entity (User ↔ Rental ↔ Equipment)
* Use of `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinTable`, `@ElementCollection`
* Custom queries to:

  * Filter by availability
  * Get equipment rented most often
  * List rentals with total revenue by month
* Pagination/sorting in equipment list
* Auditing with `@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate`
